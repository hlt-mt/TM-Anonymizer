# TM-Anonymizer
This repository contains the software to run the Translation Memory anonymization service developed within the [CEF Data MarketPlace project](https://www.datamarketplace.eu). A service based on this tool is offered by the TAUS Data MarketPlace platform.

The goal of the tool is to protect private information possibly contained in TMs uploaded to the Marketplace. This is obtained by detecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in the source and target-language sides of a translation memory. 

A PII is any data that could potentially identify a specific individual. The PIIs identified by the tool are: 

person names, emails, URLs, phone numbers, credit card numbers, driver’s license numbers, identity card numbers, passport numbers, social security numbers, license plate numbers.


## The tool
The tool includes two different libraries to extract the required PIIs from the source and target language texts. 

Person names are extracted using the [DeepPavlov NER tool](https://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/features/models/ner.html). It is a hybrid model based on [Multilingual BERT](https://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/features/models/bert.html) adapted for the named entity recognition task. Among all the possible types of entities, our tool selects only the persons. 

All the other PIIs are obtained by in-house software based on regular expressions and language-specific knowledge and patterns.

The tool is able to extract PIIs in 5 languages: English, Czech, German, Italian, Latvian. More languages will be added during the project.

The tool is accessible by an API that allows a user to process one or multiple TUs at the time. More details about the API specifications are available below.


## Installation and Usage

The Docker image of the code is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mFLAWjqBLqjek0iazXRx8V2Xt8RE_0HA/view?usp=sharing) or [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P1feBsOSYCYnmSwOQUNhv2NykBGGxzOA/view?usp=sharing)  (around 3GB) 

No specific hardware or software is required in addition to a working
"docker" installation (only the optional "email" functionality requires an email sending service running on the host)

Once the Docker image has been downloaded, it has to be added to your docker environment
```bash
$ docker load < image.anonymization_service.tar.gz
```

To start the service, run the following command:
```bash
$ docker run --rm -it --net=host anonymization_service
```

The process prints different information, when it prints the message
```bash
web service ready at port 8080
```
this means it is ready to accept requests.

Requests can be issued at the following URLs:
* http://localhost:8080/anonymization_service.php
* http://${PUBLIC-IP}:8080/anonymization_service.php


### Example

The request
```bash
curl -X POST -F units='id1|en|credit cards 1234-XXXX-YYYY of mr. John Watson and of Jochen Mass|it|bla bla bla|id2|en|We recommend the sites bbc.co.uk and cnn.com|it|Paolo Rossi and Giuseppina Verdi propongono i siti agriturismo.it dolomiti.it solocane.net' http://localhost:8080/anonymize_service.php
```
produces the response:
```bash
{"status": 0,
 "payload":
   [{"id": "id1", "side": 0,
     "annotations":
       [{"type": "CREDITCARD",
         "values":
           ["1234-XXXX-YYYY", "6666-XXXX-YYYY", "7890-XXXX-YYYY"]
        },
        {"type": "PER",
         "values":
           ["John Watson", "Jochen Mass"]
        }
       ]
    },
    {"id": "id2", "side": 0,
     "annotations":
       [{"type": "URL",
         "values":
           [ "bbc.co.uk", "cnn.com"]
        }]
    },
    {"id": "id2", "side": 1,
     "annotations":
       [{"type": "URL",
         "values":
           [ "agriturismo.it", "dolomiti.it", "solocane.net"]
        },
        {"type": "PER",
         "values":
           [ "Paolo Rossi", "Giuseppina Verdi"]
        }
       ]
    }]
}
```


## API specifications

[The API specs of the Anonymization Service are available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QXJmeA0A3af3rwxaie1e6RaLJjFwyrbo/view?usp=sharing)

## Web GUI (Graphical User Interface)

To test the tool, a web graphical interface is made available in the Docker. It consists of a simple web page, where a text can be inserted and it is processed by the tool returning the list of the identified PIIs. The GUI allows the user to provide an email address to which the output of the tool is sent.
